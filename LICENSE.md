# Bank Marketing Target Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end data science project focused on predicting customer responses to marketing campaigns in the banking sector. The project involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to classify whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

# Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model that accurately predicts customer responses to marketing campaigns. The dataset used for this project is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Key Features of the Project

# 1. Data Exploration

Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and potential issues like missing values or imbalances.

Key insights were gathered about customer demographics, behavior, and past interactions.

# 2. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

Addressed class imbalance using techniques such as oversampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

# 3. Feature Engineering

Engineered new features to enhance predictive power.

Selected significant features using statistical and machine learning-based methods.

# 4. Modeling

 Experimented with multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression (Baseline)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)

 Evaluated models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

# 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

Applied grid search and random search to optimize model hyperparameters.

# 6. Model Evaluation

Compared models on a hold-out test set and selected the best-performing model.

7. Results and Insights

Highlighted the most significant predictors of customer behavior.

Discussed the practical implications of the findings for marketing strategies.
